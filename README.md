# Map Description

This is a map of brewpub and taproom locations in Albuquerque, NM (NE Heights only). ABQ is divided into 4 quadrants by two highways; I-25 runs North and South and I-40 runs East and West. I-40 is part of the original Route 66 that began in Chicago, IL and ended in Los Angeles, CA.  

Today there are many more brewpubs in Albuquerque than are listed here. So many in fact, that Albuquerque now rivals other craft "beercation" destinations such as Portland, OR, Denver, CO, and Seattle, WA.
